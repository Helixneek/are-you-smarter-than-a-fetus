# Are You Smarter than a Fetus?
**Are You Smarter than a Fetus?** is a quiz and word puzzle game with two distinct modes:
- Trivia Mode: Players are presented with a series of multiple-choice questions covering a wide range of topics. The questions are drawn from a database and can be randomized to ensure variety. Players have a limited time to provide their answers. Scoring is based on the number of correct answers.
